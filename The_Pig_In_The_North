 
>A first world issue as factory farming is mostly found in developed western nations.

But in developing nations vast swaths of wilderness are being turned into grazing land to create beef for export. Factory farming is not the most environmentally damaging form of animal agriculture, but it is awful and it is the logical next step along the current trajectory.

>Many farms have an estimated water supply measured in centuries but 

Let's say say we have 300 years of water below us.  Best case scenario, you've proven a business model which returns a tidy profit. It would only take 5 other farms to turn 300 into 60 years worth of water. If we don't know how long it takes to replenish it, we have a problem. If it takes millenia, we're fucked. 

>Raising cattle and sheep in areas which aren't viable for crops only adds to the avilable food supply rather than reducing it.

I agree.

-Technial terms related to animal agriculture : mundane, poetic, grusome comic and euphamistic.
-Fantasy company names, parody names, individual names, both in the industry and competing alternatives.
- A rough outline of the main concerns and challenges facing a factory farm startup.
